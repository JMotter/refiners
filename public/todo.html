<h3>Jonathan - This page will help us pass info back and forth.</h3>
<br>

    <ol>

        <li>Colors: We can change this pretty easy.  You can help this process by picking a color code.  One website than
        can do this is <a src="http://html-color-codes.info/">color code website</a></li>

        <li>website hosting: As we discussed, I currently have this site on <a src="http://openshift.com">Openshift</a>.
        You might take a read of their pricing plans as the free one might not be the best long term solution for you.</li>

        <li>Google maps: We will want a key (which you may already have) so we can put a google map within your website.
        More to come here once I start working on that page.</li>

        <li>Email: We will want to create an website email account.  This account will only be used to email you with messages
        from the website.  At first, these messages will be from the websites contact page.  Once the page is up, we can
        perhaps get a bit more fancy, like tracking the number of people that hit the website each day, etc/</li>

        <li>Facebook link in the footer is not working.  The page opens, but I must have the wrong address?</li>

        <li>In the footer, I have a twitter link.  Do you have a twitter account, or should I delete this?</li>

        <li>Source Code: I currently have your page's source code at <a src="https://github.com/JMotter/refiners">Github</a>
            Before we are done, you might open you own free account here, and I can send the source code their for
        your long term ownership.</li>

        <li>Image: We need a lot of these.  I expect at least 1 per page?  Plus, multiple (3-4?) for the carousel on the
         homepage.  (... the Scrolling images...)</li>

    </ol>
